Usage
-----

The layer contains examples on how to use the SWUpdate project. Examples
on how to deploy a "dual-copy" update strategy with some common boards
(Beaglebone Black, Raspberry Pi) are provided.

Setup your environment accordingly and update `MACHINE` to desired target.

To build simply run:

	bitbake update-image

Above will generate a `swu` file suitable for usage with SWUpdate on
your device.

Note that `update-image` depends on `ext4.gz` and you must make sure
that it is part of `IMAGE_FSTYPES`.

For usage with Raspberry Pi one must add the following to `local.conf`

	RPI_USE_U_BOOT = "1"

Above will enable U-boot which Raspberry Pi does not default to, and
instead boots straight to Linux. U-boot is required to do the "swapping"
of partitions in the "dual-copy" layout.
